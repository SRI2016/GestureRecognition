# American Sign Language Pose Recognition

## Real Time Classification

A classification scheme is implemented using Ecole Centrale Paris's [RFLib](http://vision.mas.ecp.fr/Personnel/teboul/RFlib.php).

## Leap Motion Controller

We used the Leap Motion Controller and it's respective API (https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/cpp/api/Leap_Classes.html) in order to accurately recognize and classify letters of the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet.

### Limitations

For the purposes of this project, we did not include the letters 'J' and 'Z' because they are "dynamic", meaning that their sign language representation requires movement as opposed to the rest of the letters in the alphabet which are "static"

### Publication

Our work has been submitted to ICIP 2017 and is currently under review.
